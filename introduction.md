## Overview of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders 
that cause progressive cognitive decline. AD accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, 
while FTD is less common, representing 5-10% of cases. AD primarily affects memory 
and cognitive functions, while FTD often manifests as personality and behavioral changes.

Currently, there is no cure for either condition, and available treatments only provide 
limited symptomatic relief. Early diagnosis is critical for better management, 
emotional support, and planning.

## Importance of EEG in Early Diagnosis
Electroencephalography (EEG) measures brain electrical activity and is a promising 
non-invasive tool for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing 
EEG signals, researchers can detect anomalies linked to specific conditions, 
such as slowing of brain waves in AD or altered connectivity in FTD. 

Machine learning techniques enhance this process by identifying complex patterns 
within EEG data, paving the way for more accurate and timely diagnosis.

## Objectives of the Project
This project aims to:
1. Leverage EEG data to develop machine learning models for classifying AD and FTD.
2. Explore advanced techniques such as PCA, XGBoost, and Generative AI for feature 
   extraction and model optimization.
3. Provide a reproducible framework that can contribute to research on 
   neurodegenerative diseases and their diagnosis.

By combining neuroscience with machine learning, this project seeks to advance 
non-invasive diagnostic methods and support the development of targeted interventions.
